This is sample code showing a minimal example of ray tracing in Unity with with the Legacy graphics engine and the "Inline Raytracing" feature. It requires Unity 2023.2 or newer. The plane in SampleScene draws blue if a ray cast "through" the pane collides with something, green if a ray cast "off" the pane collides with something, and red if there is no collision.
